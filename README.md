# 🛠️ What's Happening in the Shop

Welcome — I'm Luke. I build intelligent tools, automate workflows, and ship weird, useful systems in the open. This space is part workshop, part lab, part field report. Here's what's in motion right now:

## 🚧 Active Projects

**🔹 VibeLegal**  
LLM-powered contract drafting system.  
Currently swapping OpenAI out for Groq, cleaning up the frontend, and preparing to deploy the MVP.  
> Tools: FastAPI · Render · Vite · Tailwind · JWT · Groq

**🔹 Worksheet Generator**  
AI-assisted printable worksheet generator for early literacy, ESL, and handwriting practice.  
Refining SVG overlays + prepping PDF export logic for mobile/print compatibility.  
> Tools: Python · WeasyPrint · Node · SVG · Vision models

**🔹 Operator Mode (internal)**  
Makefile-based CLI system for managing releases, changelogs, exports, and git logs across multiple AI tools.  
Meant to feel like your terminal is your foreman.  
> Tools: Bash · Make · Git · Personal ritual stack

**🔹 MyTable – A Personal Meal Planner for Real Life**
MyTable is a small but mighty AI-assisted meal planning app, built for everyday use by real people. Whether you're cooking for one or managing a household, MyTable helps organize recipes, shopping lists, preferences, and pantry insights — all in one beautifully simple interface.
> Tools: Vite + React·Flask (API backend)·TailwindCSS·Lucide

## 🧪 Things I’m Testing or Breaking

- Multi-model backend orchestration (Groq, Ollama, Claude)
- Auto-generated ritual cards (markdown → visual → NFT)
- Developer UX audit tools (FAL protocol, friction logging, self-corrective prompt loops)

---

## 📂 Repo Layout

- `public/` — Tools and systems clean enough to share  
- `lab/` — Active builds, not always pretty  
- `archive/` — Past experiments with useful scars  
- `infra/` — Makefiles, deploy flows, DX enhancements  
- `ritualware/` — Personal design systems + cognitive tools

## 💬 How to Use This Space

This GitHub isn’t a polished portfolio.  
It’s a working shop — noisy, evolving, occasionally on fire.  
If you’re into AI systems, personal dev tooling, or engineering as art — poke around.

- Open an issue if you want to talk shop  
- Fork something if it sparks  
- I build fast, change often, and don’t pretend to have it all figured out

## 🧠 Ethos

> "We’re not here to build empty products.  
> We’re building infrastructure for asymmetric advantage."
